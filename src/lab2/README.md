## BoxWindow class

- Edit the class `BoxWindow` in [src/sdia_python/lab2/box_window.py](./box_window.py) to make it work in any dimension (you may start with a low dimensional implementation).
- Run the tests from [`tests/lab2/`](../../tests/lab2)
- Complete the class body
  - write the docstrings
  - make sure the current tests pass
- Add new methods of your choice like `center`, etc.
- Write new tests that test various use cases of the different methods
- Create the counterpart `BallWindow` class that works at least in 1D and 2D

- [Bonus] Estimate the value of `pi` using [rejection sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling)
